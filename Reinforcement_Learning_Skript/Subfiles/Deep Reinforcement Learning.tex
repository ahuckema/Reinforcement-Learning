\section{Distributional Reinforcement Learning}
Remember that we defined $\mathbb{P}^\pi_{s,a} := \mathbb{P}^\pi \otimes \delta_{S_0}(s) \otimes \delta_{A_0}(a)$ as the probability measure of the Markov reward process $(S,A,R)$ started in $(s,a)$. We define the distribution of the return under policy $\pi$ as 
\[
Z^\pi := \sum_{t =0}^\infty \gamma^t R_t, \quad \gamma \in (0,1).
\]
Unlike the methods before, where we were interested in the expected reward $Q^\pi (s,a) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a}^\pi [Z^\pi]$, we are now interested in the distribution of these cumulative rewards. For that define the push forward 
\[
\eta_{s,a}^\pi (B) := \mathbb{P}_{s,a}^\pi (Z^\pi \in  B), \quad B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}).
\]
